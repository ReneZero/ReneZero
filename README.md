**-OffboardSingleUser** is a GAM script we use when a staff member leaves midway through the year randomly. This script will remove them from the google directory change their password to a random generated password, suspend the account and move them to a suspended OU. This will also delete their user In mosyle as well and also check in any devices that they had checked out to them in Mosyle and Snipe IT 

**-OffBoard.csv** is a GAM script we use when offbaording staff or teachers during summer. You must create a csv file where you have a header that says email in order for the script to read the data from that collum. This only has google features so far no implemnation of Mosyle or Snipe IT
